  *Features of TestNG====
  *1. I t generate Automatic report.
  *2. It supprts parallel excution(we can set diffrent set of excution)
  *3. It supports multiple annotations
  *4. Testcases can be grouped together and prority can be given easily
  *5. Parameterization can be done easily(we can set difrent set of data==multiple input combinations)
  *6. We can run only failed Testcases by the ghelp of Failed-testng.xml file

  * Junit==it has no a good reporting system, not supprt parallel excution, testcases can not be grouped toghether
